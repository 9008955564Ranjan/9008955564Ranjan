ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS
(From the Academic year 202 2 - 23 onwards)
Introduction: Analytical chemistry is a branch of chemistry that deals with chemical analysis.
Chemical analysis involves identifying and determining the percentage composition in a sample
of a substance. The identification step is carried out by Qualitative analysis. Quantitative
analysis gives the percentage composition of the constituents. Analytical chemistry deals with
the qualitative and quantitative characterization of materials. It includes a wide variety of fields
like environmental science, agricultural science, clinical chemistry, solid-state research and

electronics. It is an integral part of R & D section of any industry.
The two steps of chemical analysis in the characterization of matter are identification and
estimation of constituents of substance. The identification step is called the quantitative analysis,
which gives information regarding the presence or absence of one or more components of the
sample. The estimation step is called the quantitative analysis, which determines the exact
quantity of the constituents present in a substance.

The quantitative analysis can be classified into two types, depending upon on the method of
analysis.
i) Chemical methods of analysis or classical methods of analysis.
ii) Modern methods of analysis or Instrumental methods of analysis.

Chemical methods of analysis involve gravimetric and volumetric or titrimetric analysis.
Gravimetric analysis is the quantitative estimation by weight, which involves the process of
isolating and weighing of an element. In volumetric analysis, a known amount of the substance
to be analyzed is allowed to react with a standard solution of an appropriate reagent. The volume
of the standard reagent required to react with known amount of analyte is determined by
titration. But, volumetric analysis is time consuming and has lack of versatility and lack of
accuracy when the small amount of substances is involved.

In instrumental methods of analysis, a physical property of a substance is measured to
determine its chemical composition. An instrument converts physical property into a form that
can be readily measured and it is related quantity or quality of the sample.

For example, a photodetector measures the amount of light absorbed by a colored solution
by converting the light radiation into an electrical signal. The latter is measured by a
galvanometer. Similarly, a pH meter measures the electrical potential developed at an electrode
interface due to hydrogen ion concentration. Thus an analytical instrument is defined as a device

that converts the analytical signal (absorption of radiation, concentration, etc.) into an electrical
signal that can be read on a meter. The meter reading is a measure of the quantity of the sample.
The schematic representation of an analytical instrument is as shown in the figure.

Transducers used in some instruments are listed below.
Colorimeter → Photocell → detects the change in color.
Potentiometer → Electrochemical cell→ detects the change in potential
Conductmeter → Conductivity cell→ detects change in conductance

The detector identifies the analytical signal from the sample and converts it into an electrical
signal. It is then processed by the signal processor, which transforms the signal in such a form
that it can be recorded on a meter, x-ray recorder or digitalizer. The signal processor can amplify,
attenuate, differentiate, integrate or compare the analytical signal.

Advantages of instrumental methods of analysis:
i) It is faster than volumetric or gravimetric methods of analysis.
ii) It requires only small quantities (less than a milligram) of the sample.
iii) Easy when a large number of samples have to be analyzed.
iv) The results are accurate.

Colorimetry

Principle Colorimetry is an analytical technique used for the determination of concentration of
the compounds in a solution. The variation of the color of a system with change in concentration
of some component constitutes the basis for colorimetric analysis. It is used for the solutions,
which are themselves colored or which give color when mixed with a suitable reagent. The color
is generally developed by the addition of an appropriate coloring agent. The intensity of the
colour depends on the concentration of the constituent present. The determination of the
concentration of a substance by measuring the relative absorption of light with respect to a
known concentration of the substance forms the basis of colorimetry.

In colorimetric analysis, light from a suitable source is passed through a filter to produce
monochromatic light. The monochromatic light is passed through a solution to be tested when a
part of light is absorbed by the solution. The extent of absorption depends on the concentration
of the solution and on the path length of the light through the solution.

When a monochromatic light of intensity I is incident on a transparent medium, a portion of the
radiation is absorbed Ia, a portion of the radiation is reflected Ir and the remaining part is
transmitted It.
Io = Ia + Ir +It
For a air-glass interface, Ir is negligible and hence,
Io = Ia + It
Lambert studied the relation between Io and It while Beer extended the experiments to solutions.
Hence, colorimetry is based upon Lambert’s and Beer’s laws.

Definitions

Transmittance (T): Transmittance is the ratio of intensity of transmitted light by the sample (It)
to intensity of incident light on the sample (Io), both being measured at the same spectral position
and with the same slit width.

T = It

reciprocal of the transmittance.

Statement of Lambert’s law and Beer’s law

Lambert’s law

The relation between the incident, absorbed, transmitted light with thickness of the cell is
expressed in the form of Lambert’s law. The law states that when a beam of monochromatic
radiation passes through a homogeneous absorbing medium, the rate of decrease in the intensity
of radiation with the thickness of absorbing medium is proportional to the intensity of the
incident radiation.

The essential components of photoelectric colorimeter consist of a:

ii) Suitable optical filter – Filter is used for isolating any desired spectral region. It
allows the radiation having a wavelength, which is a characteristic for a particular
color by filtering all other wavelengths. Or filter is used to obtain the monochromatic
beam of radiation. The filter selection depends on the λmax. Colored glass or colored
gelatin coated on glass is used as filters. The filter should give the maximum
absorption or minimum transmission for a given concentration of the absorbing
substance.

used to fill the sample under analysis.

Procedure

The measurement in colorimetry at a particular wavelength involves the following sequence
operations.

A series of standard solutions are prepared using stock solution. Using a suitable coloring
reagent, the color is produced and is diluted to a known volume using distilled water.
A blank solution is prepared without the sample or analyte and the test solution (unknown
concentrated solution) is also prepared by taking given volume of sample, coloring agent
and diluted with water.
Calibration of the instrument: Keep the filter of required wavelength and select % T mode.
Set the % transmission to zero by placing a black tube in the sample holder.
Set the % transmission to 100 by placing the blank solution in the sample holder.
Change the switch to optical density (OD) mode and record the OD for a series of standard
solutions prepared and for the test solution.
Draw a calibration curve by plotting optical density (Y-axis) against volumes or
concentrations of standard solutions (X-axis). From the calibration curve, calculate the
volume of test solution or the amount of analyte present in test solution.
Advantages
i) Colorimetry gives more accurate results at low concentrations than the corresponding
titrimetric or gravimetric procedure.
ii) A colorimetric method may frequently be applied where no satisfactory gravimetric
or tritrimetric procedure exists i.e. for certain biological substances.
iii) This method is simple and rapid.

Applications
i) In quantitative analysis
A large number of metal ions, anions and organic compounds can be determined by colorimetry.
It is based on the application of Beer’s law. For example, copper content in a solution can be
determined using aqueous ammonia as the color-developing reagent. Cu++ ions react with NH 3 to
forms a deep blue colored cuprammonium complex ion.

Or
CuSO 4 + 4 NH 3  Cu (NH 3 ] 4 SO 4
cuprammonium sulfate

Take known volumes of standard copper sulfate solutions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ml) in separate
volumetric flasks. Add 5 ml of ammonia into each flask and make up to the mark with ion
exchange water. Stopper the flasks and mix the solutions well. Blank solution is prepared for the

calibration. Select the filter number 7; because for the cupammonium sulfate complex λmax
(wavelength at which maximum absorbance takes place ) is 620 nm. Then measure the
absorbance values of the standard solutions using colorimeter. Then the calibration is obtained
by plotting absorbance against volume or concentration. The test solution in which the
concentration of Cu+2 is to be determined is also treated with ammonia to develop color and its
absorbance is measured. From the calibration curve, the concentration Cu+2 in the solution or the
given volume of CuSO 4 can be determined.
Colorimetric estimation can be applied to estimate copper in brass, manganese in steel, glucose
in fluids, etc.

Potentiometry

Principle We know that Expression for Nernst equation is given by

E = E^0 + 0.0591 log [ Mn+ ]

(^) n
The potential of an electrode depends upon the concentration of the ion to which it is
reversible. In a potentiometric titration, there is a change in ionic concentration, which can be
followed by measuring the potential of a suitable electrode. Thus, the potentiometric titrations
involve the measurement of electrode potentials with the addition of the titrant (i.e., while the

Page.No. 11

Dept. of Chemistry

titration is in progress). The equivalence point of the reaction can be detected by a sudden
change in potential plot of emf reading (y-axis) and volume of the titrant (on x-axis).
The procedure of using the measurement of emf to determine the concentration of ionic solution
is referred to as potentiometry.

Instrumentation The potentiometer includes a reference electrode, an indicator electrode and a
potential measuring device. The electrode that maintains a constant potential is called a reference
electrode while the other electrode, which serves as an indicator of the changes in ion
concentration of the analyte is referred to as an indicator electrode. The indicator electrode
responds rapidly to the changes in the concentration of the analyte. A simple arrangement of
potentiometric titration is depicted in figure. A is a reference electrode (say SCE), B is the
indicator electrode and C is mechanical stirrer (can be replaced by a magnetic stirrer) and the
solution to be titrated (to be estimated) is taken in the beaker.

The emf of the cell containing the initial solution is determined and increments of 0.5 ml of the
titrant solution are added until the equivalence point is approached and each time the emf is
measured. The approach of equivalence point is indicated by a somewhat more rapid change of
the emf. Near the equivalence point, equal increments, say, 0.1 ml of titrant should be added.
Several points should be taken well beyond the end point.

Advantages
The following are the advantages of potentiometric titrations over the regular titrations involving
the use of indicators.
i) Results are accurate.
ii) Potentiometric titrations can be carried out in colored solutions where indicators
cannot be used.
iii) The prior knowledge of relative strengths of acids and bases to select a proper
indicator is necessary in ordinary titrations, while no such knowledge is required
in the case of potentiometric titrations.
iv) It is possible to determine an approximate end point in the titration of very weak
acids or very weak bases when the indicator methods are quite undesirable.

Applications of potentiometry for Redox Titrations

Redox titrations are also carried out potentiometrically. The determining factor is the
ratio of the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced forms of certain ion species. For a redox
reaction: Oxidized form + n electrons  Reduced form

The potential E acquired by the indicator electrode at 25 oC is given by
E = E^0 + 0.0591 log 10 [oxidized]
n [Reduced]

Determining factor for a redox reaction is the ratio of the concentrations of the oxidized and
reduced forms of ionic species present in the solution. Therefore, the potential of indicator
electrode is controlled by the ratio of concentrations. In redox titrations, platinum electrode is
used as an indicator electrode and calomel electrode is used as a reference electrode.

Eg: Redox titration of FAS v/s K 2 Cr 2 O 7
In this both oxidation and reduction takes place. In presence of acidic medium, Ferrous sulfate in
FAS is oxidized to Ferric sulfate (Fe2+ to Fe3+ ) and potassium dichromate is reduced to Chromic
sulfate (Cr6+ to Cr3+ ).

6 FeSO 4 + 7 H 2 SO 4 + K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ------------> 3 Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 +K 2 SO 4 + Cr 2 SO 4 + 7H 2 O
Potassium dichromate is an oxidizing agent which is taken in a burette and ferrous ammonium
sulphate is a reducing agent and is taken in a beaker. Platinum indicator electrodes is dipped into
a beaker containing acidified FAS and connect it to a reference calomel electrode to form a
complete cell setup.

Before the addition of Potassium dichromate, FAS solution contains only ferrous ions (FeANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES AND APPLICATIONS

Set the % transmission to zero by placing a black tube in the sample holder.
Set the % transmission to 100 by placing the blank solution in the sample holder.
Change the switch to optical density (OD) mode and record the OD for a series of standard
solutions prepared and for the test solution.
Draw a calibration curve by plotting optical density (Y-axis) against volumes or
concentrations of standard solutions (X-axis). From the calibration curve, calculate the
volume of test solution or the amount of analyte present in test solution.
Advantages
i) Colorimetry gives more accurate results at low concentrations than the corresponding
titrimetric or gravimetric procedure.
ii) A colorimetric method may frequently be applied where no satisfactory gravimetric
or tritrimetric procedure exists i.e. for certain biological substances.
iii) This method is simple and rapid.

Applications
i) In quantitative analysis
A large number of metal ions, anions and organic compounds can be determined by colorimetry.
It is based on the application of Beer’s law. For example, copper content in a solution can be
determined using aqueous ammonia as the color-developing reagent. Cu++ ions react with NH 3 to
forms a deep blue colored cuprammonium complex ion.

calibration. Select the filter number 7; because for the cupammonium sulfate complex λmax
(wavelength at which maximum absorbance takes place ) is 620 nm. Then measure the
absorbance values of the standard solutions using colorimeter. Then the calibration is obtained
by plotting absorbance against volume or concentration. The test solution in which the
concentration of Cu+2 is to be determined is also treated with ammonia to develop color and its
absorbance is measured. From the calibration curve, the concentration Cu+2 in the solution or the
given volume of CuSO 4 can be determined.
Colorimetric estimation can be applied to estimate copper in brass, manganese in steel, glucose
in fluids, etc.

Potentiometry

Principle We know that Expression for Nernst equation is given by

E = E^0 + 0.0591 log [ Mn+ ]

(^) n
The potential of an electrode depends upon the concentration of the ion to which it is
reversible. In a potentiometric titration, there is a change in ionic concentration, which can be
followed by measuring the potential of a suitable electrode. Thus, the potentiometric titrations
involve the measurement of electrode potentials with the addition of the titrant (i.e., while the

Page.No. 11

Dept. of Chemistry

titration is in progress). The equivalence point of the reaction can be detected by a sudden
change in potential plot of emf reading (y-axis) and volume of the titrant (on x-axis).
The procedure of using the measurement of emf to determine the concentration of ionic solution
is referred to as potentiometry.

Instrumentation The potentiometer includes a reference electrode, an indicator electrode and a
potential measuring device. The electrode that maintains a constant potential is called a reference
electrode while the other electrode, which serves as an indicator of the changes in ion
concentration of the analyte is referred to as an indicator electrode. The indicator electrode
responds rapidly to the changes in the concentration of the analyte. A simple arrangement of
potentiometric titration is depicted in figure. A is a reference electrode (say SCE), B is the
indicator electrode and C is mechanical stirrer (can be replaced by a magnetic stirrer) and the
solution to be titrated (to be estimated) is taken in the beaker.

The emf of the cell containing the initial solution is determined and increments of 0.5 ml of the
titrant solution are added until the equivalence point is approached and each time the emf is
measured. The approach of equivalence point is indicated by a somewhat more rapid change of
the emf. Near the equivalence point, equal increments, say, 0.1 ml of titrant should be added.
Several points should be taken well beyond the end point.

Advantages
The following are the advantages of potentiometric titrations over the regular titrations involving
the use of indicators.
i) Results are accurate.
ii) Potentiometric titrations can be carried out in colored solutions where indicators
cannot be used.
iii) The prior knowledge of relative strengths of acids and bases to select a proper
indicator is necessary in ordinary titrations, while no such knowledge is required
in the case of potentiometric titrations.
iv) It is possible to determine an approximate end point in the titration of very weak
acids or very weak bases when the indicator methods are quite undesirable.

Applications of potentiometry for Redox Titrations

Redox titrations are also carried out potentiometrically. The determining factor is the
ratio of the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced forms of certain ion species. For a redox
reaction: Oxidized form + n electrons  Reduced form

The potential E acquired by the indicator electrode at 25 oC is given by
E = E^0 + 0.0591 log 10 [oxidized]
n [Reduced]

Determining factor for a redox reaction is the ratio of the concentrations of the oxidized and
reduced forms of ionic species present in the solution. Therefore, the potential of indicator
electrode is controlled by the ratio of concentrations. In redox titrations, platinum electrode is
used as an indicator electrode and calomel electrode is used as a reference electrode.

Eg: Redox titration of FAS v/s K 2 Cr 2 O 7
In this both oxidation and reduction takes place. In presence of acidic medium, Ferrous sulfate in
FAS is oxidized to Ferric sulfate (Fe2+ to Fe3+ ) and potassium dichromate is reduced to Chromic
sulfate (Cr6+ to Cr3+ ).

6 FeSO 4 + 7 H 2 SO 4 + K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ------------> 3 Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 +K 2 SO 4 + Cr 2 SO 4 + 7H 2 O
Potassium dichromate is an oxidizing agent which is taken in a burette and ferrous ammonium
sulphate is a reducing agent and is taken in a beaker. Platinum indicator electrodes is dipped into
a beaker containing acidified FAS and connect it to a reference calomel electrode to form a
complete cell setup.

Before the addition of Potassium dichromate, FAS solution contains only ferrous ions (Fe
